# Coherent Diffractive Imaging

Note that this app reflects pretty much a worst case scenario regarding its numerical performance.
The calculations are performed inside a virtual environment within a web browser, which is can not leverage the full capabilities of the host machine.
If you are interested in a more performant implementation, please check out the [pyMSFT](https://gitlab.uni-rostock.de/snp/pymsft) library, which is a GPU-capable Python implementation of the methods shown in this app.
